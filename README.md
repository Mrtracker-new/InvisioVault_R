## 🛡️ Security First

<div align="center">

### 🏛️ **Bank-Level Security Protecting Your Data**

*The same encryption standards used by governments and financial institutions*

</div>

| 🔐 **Security Feature** | 🛡️ **Specification** | 🎯 **What This Means** |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **🔒 Encryption** | AES-256-CBC | Same as top-secret government files |
| **🗝️ Key Generation** | PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 | Passwords are virtually uncrackable |
| **🎲 Security Rounds** | 100K - 1M+ iterations | Even supercomputers would take centuries |
| **📁 File Support** | PNG, BMP, TIFF | Perfect quality preservation |
| **📊 Capacity** | Up to 50MB per image | Hide entire document collections |
| **💾 Memory** | <500MB usage | Runs smoothly on any modern computer |
| **🌍 Platforms** | Windows, macOS, Linux | Use anywhere, anytime |

## 🎭 **NEW: Transparent Decoy Mode Integration**

<div align="center">

### 🛡️ **Revolutionary Security Enhancement**

*Every basic operation now includes enterprise-level plausible deniability*

</div>

**🎉 What's New?**

InvisioVault now automatically protects **every file hiding operation** with advanced decoy mode technology. Users get military-grade plausible deniability without any complexity!

### 🔄 **How It Works Behind the Scenes**

#### **🔒 When You Hide Files (Basic Mode):**
```
1. 📁 You select your files and password
2. 🎭 System automatically creates innocent decoy files
3. 🛡️ Creates TWO encrypted layers in the same image:
   • Outer Layer (Decoy): Harmless files with derived password
   • Inner Layer (Real): Your actual files with your password
4. 🖼️ Result: One image that looks normal but has dual protection
```

#### **🔓 When You Extract Files (Basic Mode):**
```
1. 🔑 You enter any password
2. 🔍 System searches all datasets in the image
3. ✨ Returns the dataset that matches your password:
   • Your password → Your files
   • Other password → Other dataset (if exists)
   • Wrong password → Nothing (no trace of hidden data)
```

### 🎯 **Real-World Example**

| **👤 User Action** | **🎭 What Happens** | **🛡️ Security Benefit** |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Alice hides documents with password `"Secret123"` | System creates decoy files accessible with `"img_4567"` + Alice's real files with `"Secret123"` | If discovered, Alice can provide decoy password showing only harmless files |
| Bob tries to extract with password `"Secret123"` | Gets Alice's real documents | Only Alice (or those she trusts) can access real data |
| Eve tries to extract with wrong password | Gets nothing, no indication data exists | Perfect deniability - looks like a normal image |
| Authorities demand password | Alice provides `"img_4567"` showing innocent files | Plausible deniability maintained |

### ✨ **Key Benefits**

- **🎭 Automatic Protection**: Every hide operation includes decoy mode
- **🧠 Zero Learning Curve**: Works exactly like before, but more secure
- **🔄 Universal Compatibility**: Extract works with any decoy-mode or legacy image
- **🛡️ Plausible Deniability**: Different passwords reveal different content
- **⚡ No Performance Impact**: Still lightning-fast extraction
- **🔒 Independent Security**: Each dataset encrypted separately

### 🧪 **Try It Now!**

```bash
# Test the new decoy integration
python test_decoy_integration.py

# Create a decoy-protected image using basic hide dialog
# Then extract with different passwords to see different datasets!
```
