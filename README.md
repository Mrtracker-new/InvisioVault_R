## üéØ Key Innovation

The **revolutionary breakthrough** is the shift from **multi-pass candidate testing** to **single-pass deterministic extraction**:

### Traditional Approach (Slow)
```
1. Test 1000+ size candidates
2. Extract header for each candidate
3. Validate each header separately  
4. Extract full data for each candidate
Result: 10-30+ seconds ‚ùå
```

### Revolutionary Approach (Ultra-Fast)
```
1. Extract header ONCE
2. Read exact file size from header
3. Extract data in SINGLE PASS
Result: 1-5 seconds ‚úÖ
```
