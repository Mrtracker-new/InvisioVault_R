graph LR
    A[📁 Your Files] --> B[🔐 AES-256 Encrypt]
    B --> C[🎲 Random Positioning]
    C --> D[🖼️ Hide in Image Pixels]
    D --> E[✨ Invisible Result]
```

1. **🔐 Encryption**: Your files get military-grade AES-256 protection
2. **🎲 Randomization**: Data gets scattered randomly throughout the image
3. **🖼️ Pixel Magic**: Each bit hides in the least significant bit of image pixels
4. **✨ Invisibility**: The image looks identical - no one suspects a thing!
