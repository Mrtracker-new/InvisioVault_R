# 🚀 InvisioVault Anti-Detection Update

## 📅 **Version 1.1.0 - Anti-Detection + Randomization Compatibility Fix**
*Released: August 2025*

---

## 🎉 **Major Update: Enhanced Anti-Detection Steganography**

This update resolves a critical compatibility issue and introduces revolutionary anti-detection capabilities that evade modern steganalysis tools.

---

## 🐛 **Critical Bug Fixes**

### **✅ Fixed: Anti-Detection + Randomization Compatibility Issue**
**Problem:** When both **Anti-Detection Mode** and **Randomized LSB Positioning** were enabled together, extraction would fail with "No hidden data found" error.

**Root Cause:** The system used two different randomization mechanisms that were incompatible:
- Anti-detection used complex adaptive positioning based on image analysis
- Randomized LSB used password-derived seed randomization

**Solution:** Implemented **Hybrid Anti-Detection Mode** that:
- Uses regular randomized hiding for compatibility
- Applies light anti-detection post-processing 
- Maintains extraction compatibility with smart fallback logic
- Provides the benefits of both approaches
